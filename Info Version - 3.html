            <h2>What is COVID?</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and it affects you lungs ,airways and other
                organs too. COVID was first recognized in China, and has likely originated from animals. It is still
                unclear of how the virus came into contact with humans, and the virus has spread to other countries. The
                World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on the 11th of March, 2020.</p><br>There are
            multiple variants of COVID, each found in a different part of the world.
            <ul>
                <li>Alpha - First found in the United Kingdom</li>
                <li>Beta - First found in South America</li>
                <li>Gamma - First found in Brazil</li>
                <li>Delta - First found in India</li>
            </ul>
            The Ministry of Health is providing updates on these variants.

            <h2>COVID at School</h2>
            <p>If there are proper COVID cases at school, then the school will close down until further notice. To
                prevent COVID from getting into the school as best we can, everyone needs to follow the rules depending
                on what alert level we're currently on. Through all the levels you are encouraged to stay home when sick
                and use sanitiser when leaving a classroom. On higher levels you're encouraged to wear a mask at school,
                and assemblies are called off to help prevent any easy contamination from happening.</div>

                <p>Staying home if you're sick is really important at L1, because the risk of COVID getting spread into the

                domestic flight and when in taxis. Also make sure you keep track of where you've been.</p>
