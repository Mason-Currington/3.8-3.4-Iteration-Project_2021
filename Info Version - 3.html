Same rules apply for when to wear face coverings and keeping track of where you go. Borders are closed to almost all travellers to help stop the spread of COVID. There are controls at the borders for those entering NZ. Physical distancing rules are at least 2m separation in public areas, and 1m separation in other areas, like workplaces. Gatherings are capped off at 100 people.</p><u>Level 3:</u><p>Same rules apply as L2 when you're unwell. Same rules for face coverings, but you're also encouraged to wear them when you go out in public. Use the COVID Tracker app to help keep track of where you go. At L3 you must stay at home whenever you're not at work or school, same social distancing rules apply as L2 and you can only travel locally. Gatherings get reduced to a cap of 10 people, and only for certain activities such as weddings or funerals.</p><u>Level 4:</u><p>Level 4 is lockdown.
