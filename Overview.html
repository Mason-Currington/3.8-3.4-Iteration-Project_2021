			<ul>
				<li>Stay home if you are feeling unwell</li>
				<li>Don't breath on, or touch others</li>
				<li>Wash and dry your hands (Keep surfaces clean)</li>
				<li>Cough and sneeze into your elbow</li>
				<li>Don't share drink bottles, food or devices and phones</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Under Delta COVID, everyone who attends to the school (working or studying) is encouraged to wear a mask. There are a limited number of surgical masks at reception, and students are also expected to bring their own devices to school. School canteen IS going to be open as well. For contact tracing purposes, you'll need to keep a record of your journey to and from school everyday. You can do this by using either the COVID Tracer app or via personal written notes. Also try to keep track of any other locations you visit too. These changes allow for the teachers to manage their workloads while completing essential tasks, for the year 11 - 13 students to have sufficient time to complete internals and prepare for externals, and for targeted groups to receive additional opportunities for assessment and for year 9 and 10 students to continue learning programmes with minimal interruptions.
